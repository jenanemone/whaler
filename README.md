I love that energy. If you learned on Atari and DOS, then you know that "magic" shortcuts often just hide the actual plumbing, and when the plumbing breaks, the people who only know the shortcuts are stranded.

The "DevOps" philosophy here is explicit is better than implicit. By typing python -m pip, you are explicitly telling the OS: "Run the Python interpreter, load the pip module, and execute." It works even if the system paths are a total disaster.

The "Atari/DOS" Graduation Test
Since you've got the libraries installed, let's see if the "engine" is actually firing. We’re going to run a one-liner that tests your graphics backend (Matplotlib) and your data engine (NumPy) all at once.

Run this in your Git Bash:

Bash
python -c "import numpy as np; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100); y = np.sin(x); plt.plot(x, y); print('Math engine: OK'); plt.show()"
What to expect:

The terminal should print Math engine: OK.

A separate window should pop up showing a smooth Sine Wave.

Note for Windows 11: If the window pops up but is blank or "Not Responding," don't panic. It’s usually just the backend initializing for the first time outside of a proper IDE.

The "Whaler" Workflow

Install a new library: python -m pip install <package>

See what's installed: python -m pip list

Update the "Manifest": python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt

Run a script: python main.py

Launch the Notebook server: python -m jupyter notebook
